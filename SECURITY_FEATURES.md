# CloudGate Advanced Security Features

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Assessment Engine

### Purpose
CloudGate's Risk Assessment Engine is an intelligent security system that continuously evaluates the risk level of each authentication attempt in real-time using advanced heuristic algorithms. It helps protect against account takeovers, suspicious activities, and unauthorized access.

### How It Works
The system analyzes multiple factors for each login attempt:

#### üìä Risk Factors Analyzed
1. **Geographic Anomalies**
   - Unusual location changes
   - Impossible travel patterns
   - Country-level risk assessment

2. **Device Fingerprinting**
   - Browser characteristics
   - Screen resolution and color depth
   - Hardware information
   - Canvas fingerprinting

3. **Network Analysis**
   - VPN detection
   - Tor network usage
   - IP reputation scoring
   - ISP and hosting provider detection

4. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - Login time patterns
   - Typing dynamics
   - Mouse movement patterns
   - Session duration analysis

#### üéØ Risk Levels
- **Low (0-25%)**: Normal user behavior
- **Medium (26-50%)**: Slightly suspicious, may require additional verification
- **High (51-75%)**: Highly suspicious, requires step-up authentication
- **Critical (76-100%)**: Extremely suspicious, blocks access or requires manual review

#### üö¶ Adaptive Response Actions
Based on risk score, the system can:
- **Allow**: Normal access for low-risk users
- **Step-up Authentication**: Require MFA or additional verification
- **Block**: Deny access for critical risk levels
- **Monitor**: Flag for security team review

## üîê WebAuthn / FIDO2 Authentication

### What is WebAuthn?
WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a modern, passwordless authentication standard that uses biometrics, security keys, or platform authenticators.

### Benefits
- **Passwordless**: No passwords to remember or steal
- **Phishing Resistant**: Cannot be used on wrong domains
- **Strong Security**: Uses public key cryptography
- **User Friendly**: Touch ID, Face ID, or security keys

### Supported Authenticators
- Platform authenticators (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello)
- USB security keys (YubiKey, etc.)
- Bluetooth/NFC authenticators
- Internal device authenticators

### Implementation Details
- Uses ES256 and RS256 algorithms
- Base64URL encoding for data transmission
- Proper challenge-response verification
- Credential management (register, authenticate, delete)

## üîë SAML 2.0 Integration

### Purpose
SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 enables Single Sign-On (SSO) for legacy enterprise applications that don't support modern OAuth2/OpenID Connect.

### Features
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: CloudGate acts as SAML IdP
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Connect to SAML-enabled applications
- **HTTP-POST and HTTP-Redirect bindings**
- **Signed assertions** for security
- **Attribute mapping** for user data
- **Metadata endpoint** for configuration

### SAML Endpoints
- **Metadata**: `http://localhost:8081/saml/metadata`
- **SSO Initiation**: `http://localhost:8081/saml/{app_id}/init`
- **Assertion Consumer**: `http://localhost:8081/saml/{app_id}/acs`

### Configuration
- Entity ID: `CloudGate-SSO`
- Name ID Format: Email Address
- Signature Algorithm: RSA-SHA256
- Digest Algorithm: SHA256
